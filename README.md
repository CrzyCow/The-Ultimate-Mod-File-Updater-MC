# The-Ultimate-Mod-File-Updater
Asks the user to add a mod file, then asks what Minecraft version it wants to update it to, then it scans the mod if there are any new updates available from all trusted sources,
and if it finds one, it adds the links for the user to download, if not, then it asks the user if it wants to alter the file, to be compatible with the version selected.

Pseudocode:

    def update_mod(mod_name, target_version):
        # Step 1: Check for updates for the specified mod
        update_available = check_for_updates(mod_name)
        
        if not update_available:
            print("No updates available for the mod.")
            return
        
        # Step 2: Download the updated version of the mod
        download_url = get_download_url(mod_name, target_version)
        download_mod(download_url)
        
        # Step 3: Modify the mod's code to be compatible with the target version
        modify_mod_code(mod_name, target_version)
        
        # Step 4: Recompile the mod
        compile_mod(mod_name)
        
        # Step 5: Install the updated mod
        install_mod(mod_name)
        
        print("Mod successfully updated to version", target_version)
