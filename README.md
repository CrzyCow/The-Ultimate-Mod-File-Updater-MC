# Minecraft-Mod-File-Updater
Asks the user to add a mod file, then asks what Minecraft version it wants to update it to, then it scans the mod if there are any new updates available from all trusted sources, and if it finds one, it adds the links for the user to download, if not, then it asks the user if it wants to alter the file, to be compatible with the version selected.
